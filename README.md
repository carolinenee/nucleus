# Food Programs in Peel Region: Web Map for Nucleus Independent Living 
 
<p> This web map was created by Caroline Nee, Muhammad Khalis bin Samion and Polina Gorn for Nucleus Independent Living as part of the Sandbox Initiative that was introduced in GGR472H1: Developing Web Maps. The purpose of the map is to explore food deserts in the Peel region (Mississauga + Brampton + Caledon), based on the day of the week, time of the day, mode of transit, and type of program of interest. This map illustrates that there are many factors that can create food deserts, even if the food programs exist in the area.</p>
<p>The web map was created using the following data sources:

1. **Location of Food Programmes in Peel Region**

2. **Road Network Data**  
   Sourced from OpenStreetMap in Protocol Buffer Binary Format (PBF) for the Peel Region area:
